# e-Sport-and-Smart-Coaching-System-using-a-Multiview-Dataset

The proposed work aims to apply the latest action detection, action recognition, and action classification methods for different Karate movements using the LSTM and the ST-GCN algorithms and proposes these movements in 3D using Video Inference for Human Body Pose and Shape Estimation (VIBE).
